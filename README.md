# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design


    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    
    The client, DriverPass, requested a system that allows users to login to an interface to access various packages for purchase to aid in preparing for driving tests. Driverpass wanted the system to have the ability to allow the purchase of packages pertaining to their drving test and the system should be able to allow edits to the system database.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    I believe I was very thorough in my overall system design by taking into account the clients needs. I believe I excelled mosltly with the diagrams. In my eyes, they were very easy to follow and detailed.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    I would have liked to go more into detail on overall system security, such as various forms of firewalls and other methods of data encryption. I do not have much experience in this department however, so I was not able to provide as much detail on system security as I would have liked.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    In my design, I attempted to account for all of the various ways the user can access the data. The system is designed around any device that has an internet and browser connection. This allows for a more broad range of users, such as users that do not own a computer and purely ure their mobile devices for internet access. It is important to consider a user's needs as this will increase your customer base by allowing for a more user-friendly experience.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    I approach desigining software by trying to cover all bases first via data gathering. The more data that is collected upfront, the better. This allows for a more robust system that caters to all user needs without exclusion. When a ton of data is collected at the beginning of the system design phase, questions can be answered and adequate documentation can be prepared. Techniques I would like to use in the future is user interviews to hear which features they would like and implemnet them via user stories. Askingsking for help when stuck on certain portions of development is another strategy i plan to improve upon. I am not great at asking for help and instead I usually attempt to solve the problem myself by brute forcing my way through. I know this will not work in the long run and changes to the way I seek advice from peers could improve.
